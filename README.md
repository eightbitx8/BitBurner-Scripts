# BitBurner Scripts

This is a repository for various BitBurner scripts. It is by no means a complete set of scripts to zero-player the game.

The fastest way to get up and running with using VSCode and this repository is to execute the `./devScripts/initialSetup`
script. This will handle creating all the various components in order to get quickly into the BitBurner game locally.
